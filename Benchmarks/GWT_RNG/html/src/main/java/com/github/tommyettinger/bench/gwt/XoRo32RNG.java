/**
 * A port of Blackman and Vigna's xoroshiro128+ generator to use two 32-bit ints of state instead of two 64-bit longs;
 * should be very fast and produce moderate-quality output as-is. In statistical testing, xoroshiro always fails some
 * binary matrix rank tests, but smaller-state versions fail other tests as well. If issues with the quality become
 * apparent, you can safely run the output of {@link #nextInt()} through code like
 * {@code int output = random.nextInt(); output = ((output ^ output >>> 17) * 0xE5CB3 | 0)}, which seems to allow the
 * results of the generator to pass binary matrix rank tests as well as the other tests it normally fails, at least for
 * a longer period of testing than it can normally pass on. Similar code could be used for {@link #nextLong()}, but
 * {@link #next(int)} may need a little extra work. This does slow down the generator somewhat (especially nextLong())
 * and the quality issues may not be noticeable, so by default this quality improvement is a manual step. It's called
 * XoRo32 because it involves Xor and XorShift as well as Rotate operations on the pair of 32-bit pseudo-random states.
